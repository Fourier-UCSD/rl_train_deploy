# GR1-sim2real
Sim2Real code of GR1T2 in nvidia






only ubuntu 20.04!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
only joystick can be use !!!!!!!




Use stepsï¼š

choose which one you want use 

if you want use webots to sim:


1. put your pt model in "PythonModule/source" and change path in "gr1-rl-deploy/controllers/GR1_lite_webots/MPC_Gait/include/GaitGenerator.h"
2. change "CMakeLists_webots.txt" to "CMakeLists.txt"
3. open "#define WEBOTS"and close "#define REALROBOTS" both in "gr1-rl-deploy/controllers/GR1_lite_webots/example/src/main.cpp" and "gr1-rl-deploy/controllers/GR1_lite_webots/MPC_Gait/include/GaitGenerator.h"
4. mkdir build
5. sh autobuild.sh
6. open GR1-sim2real/gr1-rl-deploy/worlds/GR1T1L.wbt with webots
7. connect joystick
8. press A switch to zero
9. press X switch to  RL
10. enjoy your rl!


if you want use realrobot:



1. put your pt model in "PythonModule/source" and change path in "gr1-rl-deploy/controllers/GR1_lite_webots/MPC_Gait/include/GaitGenerator.h"
2. change "CMakeLists_real.txt" to "CMakeLists.txt"
3. open "#define REALROBOTS"and close "#define WEBOTS" both in "gr1-rl-deploy/controllers/GR1_lite_webots/example/src/main.cpp" and "gr1-rl-deploy/controllers/GR1_lite_webots/MPC_Gait/include/GaitGenerator.h"
4. mkdir build
5. sh autobuild.sh
6. change "absolute_pos_zero" in "gr1-rl-deploy/controllers/GR1_lite_webots/MotorList/sources/motorlist.json", correct value need copy from "home/Rocs/bin//MotorList/sources/motorlist.json"   (VERY  IMPORTANT!!)
7. connect joystick
8. press A switch to zero
9. press X switch to  RL
10. enjoy your rl!
